PYTHON IS A MULTI-PARADIGM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING AND STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING ARE FULLY SUPPORTED, AND MANY OF ITS FEATURES SUPPORT FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING AND ASPECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (INCLUDING BY METAPROGRAMMING[40] AND METAOBJECTS (MAGIC METHODS)).[41] MANY OTHER PARADIGMS ARE SUPPORTED VIA EXTENSIONS, INCLUDING DESIGN BY CONTRACT[42][43] AND LOGIC PROGRAMMING.[44]

PYTHON USES DYNAMIC TYPING, AND A COMBINATION OF REFERENCE COUNTING AND A CYCLE-DETECTING GARBAGE COLLECTOR FOR MEMORY MANAGEMENT. IT ALSO FEATURES DYNAMIC NAME RESOLUTION (LATE BINDING), WHICH BINDS METHOD AND VARIABLE NAMES DURING PROGRAM EXECUTION.

PYTHON'S DESIGN OFFERS SOME SUPPORT FOR FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING IN THE LISP TRADITION. IT HAS FILTER(), MAP(), AND REDUCE() FUNCTIONS; LIST COMPREHENSIONS, DICTIONARIES, AND SETS; AND GENERATOR EXPRESSIONS.[45] THE STANDARD LIBRARY HAS TWO MODULES (ITERTOOLS AND FUNCTOOLS) THAT IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONAL TOOLS BORROWED FROM HASKELL AND STANDARD ML.[46]

THE LANGUAGE'S CORE PHILOSOPHY IS SUMMARIZED IN THE DOCUMENT THE ZEN OF PYTHON (PEP 20), WHICH INCLUDES APHORISMS SUCH AS:[47]

BEAUTIFUL IS BETTER THAN UGLY
EXPLICIT IS BETTER THAN IMPLICIT
SIMPLE IS BETTER THAN COMPLEX
COMPLEX IS BETTER THAN COMPLICATED
READABILITY COUNTS
RATHER THAN HAVING ALL OF ITS FUNCTIONALITY BUILT INTO ITS CORE, PYTHON WAS DESIGNED TO BE HIGHLY EXTENSIBLE. THIS COMPACT MODULARITY HAS MADE IT PARTICULARLY POPULAR AS A MEANS OF ADDING PROGRAMMABLE INTERFACES TO EXISTING APPLICATIONS. VAN ROSSUM'S VISION OF A SMALL CORE LANGUAGE WITH A LARGE STANDARD LIBRARY AND EASILY EXTENSIBLE INTERPRETER STEMMED FROM HIS FRUSTRATIONS WITH ABC, WHICH ESPOUSED THE OPPOSITE APPROACH.[29]

WHILE OFFERING CHOICE IN CODING METHODOLOGY, THE PYTHON PHILOSOPHY REJECTS EXUBERANT SYNTAX (SUCH AS THAT OF PERL) IN FAVOR OF A SIMPLER, LESS-CLUTTERED GRAMMAR. AS ALEX MARTELLI PUT IT: "TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING AS 'CLEVER' IS NOT CONSIDERED A COMPLIMENT IN THE PYTHON CULTURE."[48] PYTHON'S PHILOSOPHY REJECTS THE PERL "THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO DO IT" APPROACH TO LANGUAGE DESIGN IN FAVOR OF "THERE SHOULD BE ONEâAND PREFERABLY ONLY ONEâOBVIOUS WAY TO DO IT".[47]

PYTHON'S DEVELOPERS STRIVE TO AVOID PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION, AND REJECT PATCHES TO NON-CRITICAL PARTS OF CPYTHON THAT WOULD OFFER MARGINAL INCREASES IN SPEED AT THE COST OF CLARITY.[49] WHEN SPEED IS IMPORTANT, A PYTHON PROGRAMMER CAN MOVE TIME-CRITICAL FUNCTIONS TO EXTENSION MODULES WRITTEN IN LANGUAGES SUCH AS C, OR USE PYPY, A JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER. CYTHON IS ALSO AVAILABLE, WHICH TRANSLATES A PYTHON SCRIPT INTO C AND MAKES DIRECT C-LEVEL API CALLS INTO THE PYTHON INTERPRETER.

AN IMPORTANT GOAL OF PYTHON'S DEVELOPERS IS KEEPING IT FUN TO USE. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE LANGUAGE'S NAMEâA TRIBUTE TO THE BRITISH COMEDY GROUP MONTY PYTHON[50]âAND IN OCCASIONALLY PLAYFUL APPROACHES TO TUTORIALS AND REFERENCE MATERIALS, SUCH AS EXAMPLES THAT REFER TO SPAM AND EGGS (FROM A FAMOUS MONTY PYTHON SKETCH) INSTEAD OF THE STANDARD FOO AND BAR.[51][52]

A COMMON NEOLOGISM IN THE PYTHON COMMUNITY IS PYTHONIC, WHICH CAN HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF MEANINGS RELATED TO PROGRAM STYLE. TO SAY THAT CODE IS PYTHONIC IS TO SAY THAT IT USES PYTHON IDIOMS WELL, THAT IT IS NATURAL OR SHOWS FLUENCY IN THE LANGUAGE, THAT IT CONFORMS WITH PYTHON'S MINIMALIST PHILOSOPHY AND EMPHASIS ON READABILITY. IN CONTRAST, CODE THAT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND OR READS LIKE A ROUGH TRANSCRIPTION FROM ANOTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS CALLED UNPYTHONIC.

USERS AND ADMIRERS OF PYTHON, ESPECIALLY THOSE CONSIDERED KNOWLEDGEABLE OR EXPERIENCED, ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS PYTHONISTS, PYTHONISTAS, AND PYTHONEERS.[53][54]

SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS
MAIN ARTICLE: PYTHON SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS
PYTHON IS MEANT TO BE AN EASILY READABLE LANGUAGE. ITS FORMATTING IS VISUALLY UNCLUTTERED, AND IT OFTEN USES ENGLISH KEYWORDS WHERE OTHER LANGUAGES USE PUNCTUATION. UNLIKE MANY OTHER LANGUAGES, IT DOES NOT USE CURLY BRACKETS TO DELIMIT BLOCKS, AND SEMICOLONS AFTER STATEMENTS ARE OPTIONAL. IT HAS FEWER SYNTACTIC EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES THAN C OR PASCAL.[55]

INDENTATION
MAIN ARTICLE: PYTHON SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS Â§ INDENTATION
PYTHON USES WHITESPACE INDENTATION, RATHER THAN CURLY BRACKETS OR KEYWORDS, TO DELIMIT BLOCKS. AN INCREASE IN INDENTATION COMES AFTER CERTAIN STATEMENTS; A DECREASE IN INDENTATION SIGNIFIES THE END OF THE CURRENT BLOCK.[56] THUS, THE PROGRAM'S VISUAL STRUCTURE ACCURATELY REPRESENTS THE PROGRAM'S SEMANTIC STRUCTURE.[1] THIS FEATURE IS ALSO SOMETIMES TERMED THE OFF-SIDE RULE.

STATEMENTS AND CONTROL FLOW
PYTHON'S STATEMENTS INCLUDE (AMONG OTHERS):

THE ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT (TOKEN '=', THE EQUALS SIGN). THIS OPERATES DIFFERENTLY THAN IN TRADITIONAL IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, AND THIS FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISM (INCLUDING THE NATURE OF PYTHON'S VERSION OF VARIABLES) ILLUMINATES MANY OTHER FEATURES OF THE LANGUAGE. ASSIGNMENT IN C, E.G., X = 2, TRANSLATES TO "TYPED VARIABLE NAME X RECEIVES A COPY OF NUMERIC VALUE 2". THE (RIGHT-HAND) VALUE IS COPIED INTO AN ALLOCATED STORAGE LOCATION FOR WHICH THE (LEFT-HAND) VARIABLE NAME IS THE SYMBOLIC ADDRESS. THE MEMORY ALLOCATED TO THE VARIABLE IS LARGE ENOUGH (POTENTIALLY QUITE LARGE) FOR THE DECLARED TYPE. IN THE SIMPLEST CASE OF PYTHON ASSIGNMENT, USING THE SAME EXAMPLE, X = 2, TRANSLATES TO "(GENERIC) NAME X RECEIVES A REFERENCE TO A SEPARATE, DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED OBJECT OF NUMERIC (INT) TYPE OF VALUE 2." THIS IS TERMED BINDING THE NAME TO THE OBJECT. SINCE THE NAME'S STORAGE LOCATION DOESN'T CONTAIN THE INDICATED VALUE, IT IS IMPROPER TO CALL IT A VARIABLE. NAMES MAY BE SUBSEQUENTLY REBOUND AT ANY TIME TO OBJECTS OF GREATLY VARYING TYPES, INCLUDING STRINGS, PROCEDURES, COMPLEX OBJECTS WITH DATA AND METHODS, ETC. SUCCESSIVE ASSIGNMENTS OF A COMMON VALUE TO MULTIPLE NAMES, E.G., X = 2; Y = 2; Z = 2 RESULT IN ALLOCATING STORAGE TO (AT MOST) THREE NAMES AND ONE NUMERIC OBJECT, TO WHICH ALL THREE NAMES ARE BOUND. SINCE A NAME IS A GENERIC REFERENCE HOLDER IT IS UNREASONABLE TO ASSOCIATE A FIXED DATA TYPE WITH IT. HOWEVER AT A GIVEN TIME A NAME WILL BE BOUND TO SOME OBJECT, WHICH WILL HAVE A TYPE; THUS THERE IS DYNAMIC TYPING.
THE IF STATEMENT, WHICH CONDITIONALLY EXECUTES A BLOCK OF CODE, ALONG WITH ELSE AND ELIF (A CONTRACTION OF ELSE-IF).
THE FOR STATEMENT, WHICH ITERATES OVER AN ITERABLE OBJECT, CAPTURING EACH ELEMENT TO A LOCAL VARIABLE FOR USE BY THE ATTACHED BLOCK.
THE WHILE STATEMENT, WHICH EXECUTES A BLOCK OF CODE AS LONG AS ITS CONDITION IS TRUE.
THE TRY STATEMENT, WHICH ALLOWS EXCEPTIONS RAISED IN ITS ATTACHED CODE BLOCK TO BE CAUGHT AND HANDLED BY EXCEPT CLAUSES; IT ALSO ENSURES THAT CLEAN-UP CODE IN A FINALLY BLOCK WILL ALWAYS BE RUN REGARDLESS OF HOW THE BLOCK EXITS.
THE RAISE STATEMENT, USED TO RAISE A SPECIFIED EXCEPTION OR RE-RAISE A CAUGHT EXCEPTION.
THE CLASS STATEMENT, WHICH EXECUTES A BLOCK OF CODE AND ATTACHES ITS LOCAL NAMESPACE TO A CLASS, FOR USE IN OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.
THE DEF STATEMENT, WHICH DEFINES A FUNCTION OR METHOD.
THE WITH STATEMENT, FROM PYTHON 2.5 RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 2006,[57] WHICH ENCLOSES A CODE BLOCK WITHIN A CONTEXT MANAGER (FOR EXAMPLE, ACQUIRING A LOCK BEFORE THE BLOCK OF CODE IS RUN AND RELEASING THE LOCK AFTERWARDS, OR OPENING A FILE AND THEN CLOSING IT), ALLOWING RESOURCE ACQUISITION IS INITIALIZATION (RAII)-LIKE BEHAVIOR AND REPLACES A COMMON TRY/FINALLY IDIOM.[58]
THE PASS STATEMENT, WHICH SERVES AS A NOP. IT IS SYNTACTICALLY NEEDED TO CREATE AN EMPTY CODE BLOCK.
THE ASSERT STATEMENT, USED DURING DEBUGGING TO CHECK FOR CONDITIONS THAT OUGHT TO APPLY.
THE YIELD STATEMENT, WHICH RETURNS A VALUE FROM A GENERATOR FUNCTION. FROM PYTHON 2.5, YIELD IS ALSO AN OPERATOR. THIS FORM IS USED TO IMPLEMENT COROUTINES.
THE IMPORT STATEMENT, WHICH IS USED TO IMPORT MODULES WHOSE FUNCTIONS OR VARIABLES CAN BE USED IN THE CURRENT PROGRAM. THERE ARE THREE WAYS OF USING IMPORT: IMPORT <MODULE NAME> [AS <ALIAS>] OR FROM <MODULE NAME> IMPORT * OR FROM <MODULE NAME> IMPORT <DEFINITION 1> [AS <ALIAS 1>], <DEFINITION 2> [AS <ALIAS 2>], ....
THE PRINT STATEMENT WAS CHANGED TO THE PRINT() FUNCTION IN PYTHON 3.[59]
PYTHON DOES NOT SUPPORT TAIL CALL OPTIMIZATION OR FIRST-CLASS CONTINUATIONS, AND, ACCORDING TO GUIDO VAN ROSSUM, IT NEVER WILL.[60][61] HOWEVER, BETTER SUPPORT FOR COROUTINE-LIKE FUNCTIONALITY IS PROVIDED IN 2.5, BY EXTENDING PYTHON'S GENERATORS.[62] BEFORE 2.5, GENERATORS WERE LAZY ITERATORS; INFORMATION WAS PASSED UNIDIRECTIONALLY OUT OF THE GENERATOR. FROM PYTHON 2.5, IT IS POSSIBLE TO PASS INFORMATION BACK INTO A GENERATOR FUNCTION, AND FROM PYTHON 3.3, THE INFORMATION CAN BE PASSED THROUGH MULTIPLE STACK LEVELS.[63]

EXPRESSIONS
SOME PYTHON EXPRESSIONS ARE SIMILAR TO LANGUAGES SUCH AS C AND JAVA, WHILE SOME ARE NOT:

ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, AND MULTIPLICATION ARE THE SAME, BUT THE BEHAVIOR OF DIVISION DIFFERS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DIVISIONS IN PYTHON. THEY ARE FLOOR DIVISION AND INTEGER DIVISION.[64] PYTHON ALSO ADDED THE ** OPERATOR FOR EXPONENTIATION.
FROM PYTHON 3.5, THE NEW @ INFIX OPERATOR WAS INTRODUCED. IT IS INTENDED TO BE USED BY LIBRARIES SUCH AS NUMPY FOR MATRIX MULTIPLICATION.[65][66]
IN PYTHON, == COMPARES BY VALUE, VERSUS JAVA, WHICH COMPARES NUMERICS BY VALUE[67] AND OBJECTS BY REFERENCE.[68] (VALUE COMPARISONS IN JAVA ON OBJECTS CAN BE PERFORMED WITH THE EQUALS() METHOD.) PYTHON'S IS OPERATOR MAY BE USED TO COMPARE OBJECT IDENTITIES (COMPARISON BY REFERENCE). IN PYTHON, COMPARISONS MAY BE CHAINED, FOR EXAMPLE A <= B <= C.
PYTHON USES THE WORDS AND, OR, NOT FOR ITS BOOLEAN OPERATORS RATHER THAN THE SYMBOLIC &&, ||, ! USED IN JAVA AND C.
PYTHON HAS A TYPE OF EXPRESSION TERMED A LIST COMPREHENSION. PYTHON 2.4 EXTENDED LIST COMPREHENSIONS INTO A MORE GENERAL EXPRESSION TERMED A GENERATOR EXPRESSION.[45]
ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED USING LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS; HOWEVER, THESE ARE LIMITED IN THAT THE BODY CAN ONLY BE ONE EXPRESSION.
CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS IN PYTHON ARE WRITTEN AS X IF C ELSE Y[69] (DIFFERENT IN ORDER OF OPERANDS FROM THE C ? X : Y OPERATOR COMMON TO MANY OTHER LANGUAGES).
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
PYTHON FEATURES SEQUENCE UNPACKING WHERE MULTIPLE EXPRESSIONS, EACH EVALUATING TO ANYTHING THAT CAN BE ASSIGNED TO (A VARIABLE, A WRITABLE PROPERTY, ETC.), ARE ASSOCIATED IN THE IDENTICAL MANNER TO THAT FORMING TUPLE LITERALS AND, AS A WHOLE, ARE PUT ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE EQUAL SIGN IN AN ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT. THE STATEMENT EXPECTS AN ITERABLE OBJECT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE EQUAL SIGN THAT PRODUCES THE SAME NUMBER OF VALUES AS THE PROVIDED WRITABLE EXPRESSIONS WHEN ITERATED THROUGH, AND WILL ITERATE THROUGH IT, ASSIGNING EACH OF THE PRODUCED VALUES TO THE CORRESPONDING EXPRESSION ON THE LEFT.[CITATION NEEDED]
PYTHON HAS A "STRING FORMAT" OPERATOR %. THIS FUNCTIONS ANALOGOUS TO PRINTF FORMAT STRINGS IN C, E.G. "SPAM=%S EGGS=%D" % ("BLAH", 2) EVALUATES TO "SPAM=BLAH EGGS=2". IN PYTHON 3 AND 2.6+, THIS WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY THE FORMAT() METHOD OF THE STR CLASS, E.G. "SPAM={0} EGGS={1}".FORMAT("BLAH", 2). PYTHON 3.6 ADDED "F-STRINGS": BLAH = "BLAH"; EGGS = 2; F'SPAM={BLAH} EGGS={EGGS}'.[71]
PYTHON HAS VARIOUS KINDS OF STRING LITERALS:
STRINGS DELIMITED BY SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTE MARKS. UNLIKE IN UNIX SHELLS, PERL AND PERL-INFLUENCED LANGUAGES, SINGLE QUOTE MARKS AND DOUBLE QUOTE MARKS FUNCTION IDENTICALLY. BOTH KINDS OF STRING USE THE BACKSLASH (\) AS AN ESCAPE CHARACTER. STRING INTERPOLATION BECAME AVAILABLE IN PYTHON 3.6 AS "FORMATTED STRING LITERALS".[71]
TRIPLE-QUOTED STRINGS, WHICH BEGIN AND END WITH A SERIES OF THREE SINGLE OR DOUBLE QUOTE MARKS. THEY MAY SPAN MULTIPLE LINES AND FUNCTION LIKE HERE DOCUMENTS IN SHELLS, PERL AND RUBY.
RAW STRING VARIETIES, DENOTED BY PREFIXING THE STRING LITERAL WITH AN R. ESCAPE SEQUENCES ARE NOT INTERPRETED; HENCE RAW STRINGS ARE USEFUL WHERE LITERAL BACKSLASHES ARE COMMON, SUCH AS REGULAR EXPRESSIONS AND WINDOWS-STYLE PATHS. COMPARE "@-QUOTING" IN C#.
PYTHON HAS ARRAY INDEX AND ARRAY SLICING EXPRESSIONS ON LISTS, DENOTED AS A[KEY], A[START:STOP] OR A[START:STOP:STEP]. INDEXES ARE ZERO-BASED, AND NEGATIVE INDEXES ARE RELATIVE TO THE END. SLICES TAKE ELEMENTS FROM THE START INDEX UP TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING, THE STOP INDEX. THE THIRD SLICE PARAMETER, CALLED STEP OR STRIDE, ALLOWS ELEMENTS TO BE SKIPPED AND REVERSED. SLICE INDEXES MAY BE OMITTED, FOR EXAMPLE A[:] RETURNS A COPY OF THE ENTIRE LIST. EACH ELEMENT OF A SLICE IS A SHALLOW COPY.
IN PYTHON, A DISTINCTION BETWEEN EXPRESSIONS AND STATEMENTS IS RIGIDLY ENFORCED, IN CONTRAST TO LANGUAGES SUCH AS COMMON LISP, SCHEME, OR RUBY. THIS LEADS TO DUPLICATING SOME FUNCTIONALITY. FOR EXAMPLE:

LIST COMPREHENSIONS VS. FOR-LOOPS
CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS VS. IF BLOCKS
THE EVAL() VS. EXEC() BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS (IN PYTHON 2, EXEC IS A STATEMENT); THE FORMER IS FOR EXPRESSIONS, THE LATTER IS FOR STATEMENTS.
STATEMENTS CANNOT BE A PART OF AN EXPRESSION, SO LIST AND OTHER COMPREHENSIONS OR LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS, ALL BEING EXPRESSIONS, CANNOT CONTAIN STATEMENTS. A PARTICULAR CASE OF THIS IS THAT AN ASSIGNMENT STATEMENT SUCH AS A = 1 CANNOT FORM PART OF THE CONDITIONAL EXPRESSION OF A CONDITIONAL STATEMENT. THIS HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF AVOIDING A CLASSIC C ERROR OF MISTAKING AN ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR = FOR AN EQUALITY OPERATOR == IN CONDITIONS: IF (C = 1) { ... } IS SYNTACTICALLY VALID (BUT PROBABLY UNINTENDED) C CODE BUT IF C = 1: ... CAUSES A SYNTAX ERROR IN PYTHON.
